# ClassroomCLI
CLI for Google Classroom. Runs entirely in cmd, no mingw installation required

# Open Alpha
As pretty much none of the features have been implemented except for the basic CLI, there won't be anything in the Releases page.

However, feel free to go and compile the source code yourself!
